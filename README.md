This is a finance tool for small people groups which allows members to know debts among themselves. For example, a family with shared expenses that want to know who spent more money. Or a students home whose habitants use to reach an agreement time to time so that them all pay the same amount of money.
This is a mobile development based on Xamarin Forms and SyncFusion's Xamarin controls.
Server side is not included in this repository. For development and test purposes I've used Json-server tool, which implements a REST API data service based in a Json file.
